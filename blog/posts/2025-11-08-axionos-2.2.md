Another month of manual security patch bumps without Google and Material You Expressive. Is the Android Closed Source Project real? Regardless, we bring another update to the table with a fresh set of fixes and improvements that enhance your experience over the last release.

## Clearing the Misunderstanding: The Beauty of Pastels Over Glass and Blurs

We’re not copying NothingOS—we’re drawing inspiration from it, adopting certain elements of their design language while we develop our own unique identity. Since AxionOS doesn’t yet have a dedicated UI team, I need to establish a recognizable aesthetic while completing the core framework.

To be clear, NothingOS and HelloUI are the only OEM skins that don’t fully follow the iOS route, which is why they serve as references. HelloUI, in particular, still carries some iOS influence. Fun fact: the Rookery font we’re using was originally from Motorola.

## What's the Spice?

### Clocks

* With NothingOS having a stale 4.0 update, we decided to make some adjustments. Unlike real NothingOS clocks, all of our clocks now support QuickLook

### Partial Theme Engine Implementation: Font Manager

* Users can now import their favorite fonts and use them as long as they're accepted by the Android system

### Power Button Short Press

* Inspired by HyperOS and initiated by Saikrishna1504 — added for accessibility

### Services Are More Persistent and Stable

* Reports like Edge Bar and Axion Widgets stopping are now resolved. Services are now efficient and stable

### Adjustments Here and There Based on Community Feedback

* Adjusted clock heights and added fixes for devices with issues on our doze animation port

### Task Menu Close Now Force-Stops

* [View commit on GitHub](https://github.com/AxionAOSP/android_packages_apps_Launcher3/commit/a7fcd4e48488a84b8982404a93d232bf2cab9a4d)

### New QS Tiles and widget

* Added our own version of ringer slider, volume, and torch tiles

## Launch Apps Everywhere

Sidebar is now improved (aside from AOSP Freeform focus issues). With the new long press to trigger pop-up, you can now launch any app in full screen!

## Changes to Boost Framework

* **Memory Manager:** Removed NothingOS usage-based memory management
* **Added Userspace Simple LMK (Optional):** System-pressure-based (IO/CPU/memory pressure) simple low memory killer based on kerneltoast's kernel SLMK

## Something’s Coming — Clean, Custom, Yours

We’re keeping things simple while giving you full control over your device’s look.
A completely **new Theme Engine** is in active development — built from the ground up to let you customize every visual detail without adding bloat or clutter.

Our vision:
- **Clean base with limitless customization** — fully optional for users who prefer a minimal look.
- **No preloaded gimmicks** — you set the tone, your device reflects your style.
- **Thoughtfully designed API and specs** — currently being drafted to integrate seamlessly with AOSP’s framework.

It’s more than a theme system — it’s your personal creative space on Android.

## The Roadmap

The journey of AxionOS continues — structured but always evolving.

1. **Establish the AxionOS Core Framework**
   Build a stable foundation for Axion-specific services and performance tuning.

2. **Introduce the Axion SDK**
   Provide tools for maintainers and contributors to easily extend Axion’s ecosystem.

3. **Core Feature Integrations**
   - **Theme Engine** — custom from the ground up (in development)
   - **Boost Framework** — optimize runtime performance
   - **Ax Scheduling** — adaptive process scheduling, derived from reversed OnePlus code

4. **AxionUI Development**
   A distinct identity: lightweight, expressive, and designed to evolve with user feedback.

5. **Upstream Readiness**
   Prepare AxionOS for seamless future merges and long-term maintenance.

## Why Are There Too Many Bugs on Stable Release?

### Coming Back to The ACSP — Android Closed Source Project

The firmware used for Axion's or LineageOS base is QPR0 — a very early phase of AOSP where many things are still work-in-progress and really not recommended for daily usage. However, due to Google not releasing QPR1 (the stable version Pixel users know), everything here is not polished because it's WIP and in the first stage of firmware development release.

LineageOS has already fixed many of these issues, but unfortunately, not all can be fixed even with the utmost diligence. In response to this, we have added links to the bug fixes as proof.

## Fixed 69 Bugs, Added 178 Bugs

Kidding aside, we fixed critical issues and improved major custom ROM features that users actually need.

### Improved Spoofing

Some apps that implement RootBeerNative (like banks) are invasively checking every property, mount point, and partition you have. With the help of PIF and system core patches, we managed to skip some checks that caused apps to crash and Play Integrity to fail. This includes fixing a legacy spoofing patch that wasn't working before:

* [System core spoofing fix #1](https://github.com/AxionAOSP/android_system_core/commit/b405d22a0c51aa407e031df012b8d6f208ff03ba)
* [System core spoofing fix #2](https://github.com/AxionAOSP/android_system_core/commit/314d1cc5be4ba5a384e652bd22960f382ea306e6)

### Critical Bug Fixes

* **Fixed legacy device random reboots and cgroup failures** — [View commit](https://github.com/AxionAOSP/android_system_core/commit/927e0d126f912c88b4253f18ab2913b8749ab1d3)
* **Fixed biometrics freezing and lockscreen disappearance issue once and for all** — [View commit](https://github.com/AxionAOSP/android_frameworks_base/commit/285f3b1b510c3f73ce9aa94b2ada460cb7b00f3a)
* **Fixed full screen feature** — Say goodbye to those black bars! [View commit](https://github.com/AxionAOSP/android_frameworks_base/commit/6a946d50e4e42386671013060b16d1613dace8ee)

* **Fixed inconsistent fingerprint icon** — [View commit](https://github.com/AxionAOSP/android_frameworks_base/commit/fda7ee24ae91b46e2086fdb875868cb08b7479b9)
* **Attempted fix for app icon corruption that leads to system not responding** — [View commit](https://github.com/AxionAOSP/android_frameworks_libs_systemui/commit/b74df732a5881d14a8254c222c9c0d51e603ada6)

### Why Is Development and Fixes So Slow?

I’m the sole developer behind AxionOS (rmp22). Fortunately, our moderators and maintainers help by contributing missing custom ROM patches (credits to all contributors!) and keeping the community running smoothly.

Most of the time, though, I’m juggling bug fixes and working through the roadmap. Progress can feel slow, but I’m doing my best to stay on schedule and deliver stable, meaningful updates.

## Dear Google, Stop Killing What People Loved About You

You were loved for being open source and accessible, yet here we are — disappointments from custom ROMs, to sideloading, to Pixels. It's not too late, Google.

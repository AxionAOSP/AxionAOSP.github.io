---

After months of waiting, Google finally released the QPR1 sources and with that, AxionOS moves into a new chapter.

This release isn’t about claiming superiority or drawing lines between projects.
It’s about reflecting on where we are, listening to feedback we’ve heard from users over time, and deciding how AxionOS can grow in its own way.

AxionOS 2.3 represents a step toward clarity, refinement, and a more intentional experience.

## Breaking the stereotypes

Over the years, we’ve seen a growing sentiment from parts of the Android community. Especially from users who’ve stepped away from custom ROMs or grown tired of hopping between them.

Some feel that:
- Many ROMs offer similar feature sets
- Differences can feel subtle rather than meaningful
- OEM software has improved enough that switching no longer feels necessary

These aren’t criticisms of any project or team. Maintaining a custom ROM is hard work, often done by small groups in their free time. We deeply respect every maintainer and contributor keeping this ecosystem alive.

But hearing these perspectives made me stop and ask myself:

> What can AxionOS do differently?

Rather than chasing feature parity or trends, 2.3 focuses on **intent**: refining the experience, strengthening our identity, and making design and functionality feel cohesive.

## Does the Glass Reflect *You*?

It’s no secret that Android UI discussions often circle back to iOS-inspired design.

Some users enjoy it. Others feel it overshadows what made Android special in the first place.

For AxionOS, our goal isn’t to reject any design language outright, nor to follow one blindly. Instead, we want to explore Android’s strengths:
- Personal expression through color
- Flexibility without overwhelming complexity
- A UI that adapts to the user, not the other way around

AxionOS’s visual direction is still evolving, and 2.3 is an important step in shaping that identity.

## The Axion Starts Here

Back in 2.2, we shared a small tease: **“Something’s coming.”**
With 2.3, that vision begins to take form.

### Deal: we get less themes to maintain. You get more themes

The new **Theme Engine** is a modular theming solution insipired from substratum.

Key ideas behind it:
- Modular customization rather than all-or-nothing themes
- Clean system-wide integration
- Support for repackaged icon themes (power users can simply repack or use 3rd party themes)

This is the foundation we’ll continue building on, guided by feedback from users and contributors alike.

## Making Daily Use Easier

### No more cat and mouse with big G

Dealing with Play Integrity and app compatibility has been frustrating for many users across the Android modding space.

To reduce the hassle of rooting to simply pass integrity, AxionOS 2.3 integrates **Tricky Store** and **Play Integrity Fix (PIF)** directly into the system.

The goal of the this change was to:
- reduce manual steps
- make GUI access easier for users

## What’s New in 2.3

### Pulse Launcher — Refined

The launcher is often the first thing users interact with, so we focused on polish and usability:
- Icon and folder customization
- Multiple search provider options
- Universal search for apps, contacts, and settings

</div>

### Aesthetics With Security in Mind

Media artwork now appears on **Doze** and **Always-On Display**, offering a more cohesive experience while listening to music.

A new **Fading Blocks** visualizer style was also added, along with a fix for the Pulse visualizer not working when using Bluetooth devices.

### App Spoofing Enhancements

App spoofing is now:
- Fully configurable per game
- Easier to manage with presets
- Open to advanced customization for users who want more control

</div>

### Sandbox: More Control Over App Privacy

Sandbox introduces a different approach to app-level privacy:
- Separate lock for selected apps
- Hidden apps accessible within Sandbox
- Optional isolation mode per app
- Ability to hide Developer Options from specific apps

## AxBurstEngine Returns

AxBurstEngine makes a return with improvements to scheduling and UI smoothness, aiming for a more responsive and consistent experience.

By preventing certain processes from being scheduled on high-energy cores, 
we aim to allocate resources more efficiently and reduce power consumption, 
in hopes of improving the overall user experience.

## About Stability

AxionOS 2.3 is just an **initial** release. Some features from the previous version are still missing and will be added after some releases.

QPR1 is still relatively new, and while we’ve tested extensively, real-world usage always reveals areas to improve. If you encounter issues:
- Please report them with logs
- Be patient with responses
- Know that your feedback directly helps shape future releases


## Why AxionOS Exists

Custom ROMs mean different things to different people.

For some, they’re about control.
For others, learning, experimentation, or simply keeping older devices alive.

AxionOS exists to contribute positively to that space, offering an option for users who want a refined, thoughtful experience while remaining open, collaborative, and community-driven.

## Thank You

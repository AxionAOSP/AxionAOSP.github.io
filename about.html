      <p>
        <i class="highlight">AxionOS</i> is made to deliver a clean, smooth, and reliable Android experience.
        It is a <i class="highlight">minimalist ROM</i>, not a feature-focused one.
        We prefer to do fewer things and do them well.
        Every change has a clear purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        AxionOS exists to challenge the idea that custom ROMs are just a copy of one another.
        This project is also a personal research effort by <i class="highlight">rmp22</i> to learn more about Android system development.
        We avoid taking aka cherry-picking major features from other ROMs to challenge ourselves,
        and to respect the creativity and hard work of the projects that originally made them.
        Instead, we study how OEMs like Motorola, Pixel, Samsung, and others build their software.
        We <i class="highlight">reverse-engineer</i> how features behave and re-implement them using our own code.
        No OEM source code is copied or reused to avoid copyright, and everything is designed to fit cleanly into
        <i class="highlight">AOSP</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        AxionOS is minimalist by default, but flexible by design.
        Some parts of the system, such as the <i class="highlight">theme engine</i>, are built in a modular way
        for users who enjoy customization.
        At the same time, users who prefer simplicity can use AxionOS as-is, without extra clutter.
        Our focus is on balance, polish, and long-term stability.
